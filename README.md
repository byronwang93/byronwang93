### 🌱 More About Me 🌱

Originally coming from the health sciences field, I made the switch to pursue a career in computer science January of 2021 and I've never looked back! If you catch me outside of the coding booth, you'll likely see me doing one of the following:

- playing ping pong
- doodling and making fun animations (peep my youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtNVS3vcyncIzCj_dKQdQBA 👀)
- struggle at playing the piano
- bowling 😌
